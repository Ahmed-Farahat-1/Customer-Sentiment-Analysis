### Project Title: **Customer Sentiment and Trend Analysis**

#### Project Overview:
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis and trend identification on multiple datasets containing customer feedback, such as product reviews and tweets, in both English and Arabic. By leveraging various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, the goal is to classify customer sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and uncover trends in their opinions. The project applies both traditional machine learning algorithms and advanced deep learning models, like transformers and LSTMs, to improve sentiment prediction accuracy.

#### Datasets:
The project utilizes several large, well-known datasets:
1. **[Sentiment140 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)**: 1.6 million tweets labeled with positive or negative sentiment.
2. **[Amazon Product Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews/data)**: Reviews from Amazon products with sentiment labels.
3. **[IMDB Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews)**: 50,000 movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
4. **[Arabic Sentiment Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/rehab8reda/arabic-sentiment-analysis)**: A dataset of Arabic tweets labeled with sentiment categories.

#### Key Features and Techniques:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Text cleaning: Removal of stop words, punctuation, and irrelevant characters (URLs, mentions, etc.).
   - Text normalization: Tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization for both English and Arabic text.
   - Feature extraction: Techniques such as TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, and GloVe embeddings are used to convert text into numerical representations.

2. **Modeling Approaches**:
   - Traditional machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained on processed features to predict sentiment.
   - Deep learning models: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with LSTM layers are implemented to capture sequential dependencies in text data. Transformer-based models like **DistilBERT** are used to improve classification accuracy.
   - Custom models for Arabic sentiment analysis using specialized tokenizers and embeddings for Arabic text.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualizations such as word clouds, confusion matrices, and loss/accuracy graphs are generated to interpret results and improve model performance.

4. **Advanced Techniques and Tools**:
   - **MLflow Integration**: All models are tracked and managed using MLflow on Dagshub for version control, hyperparameter tuning, and experiment tracking.
   - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Basic GAN models are implemented to generate synthetic customer feedback data for further analysis and experimentation.

#### Project Deliverables:
- Cleaned datasets and data preprocessing notebooks.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) reports with visualizations.
- Trained sentiment analysis models (both traditional and deep learning).
- MLflow logs tracking model training and performance metrics.
- Final report summarizing the models, results, and future work.
